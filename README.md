# Final_project (UBER_Analysis)
Segment two:
According to the plan: our team chose a particular database for our presentation, we've got an idea of what we want to demonstrate/create with that data. All the code part is done, we've got a final  (csv, xlsx, and json just in case we need) file of the data The next step is to create a visualization of our database, we're going to use either Tableau method or create a website and have every step of the work that was completed in it.

If I had more time to investigate for finer tuning in the database, I would add a (longitude and latitude) column section to the database because for presentation it would show an amazing map graph in Tableau (our database contains a lot of duration and places) that could possibly be more helpful to see for the visualization part.
